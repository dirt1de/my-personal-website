# 1. Introduction

For this post, we will use the data about the Great American Beer Festival. Specifically, three kinds of visualization would be created to reveal the geological information in this data.

# 2. Visualization

## 2.1 Racing Bar Plot

In this section, the racing bar plot is created. Based on this graphic, you will be able to know what are the top 10 states that received the most number of awards in each year from 1987 to 2020. 

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(viridis)
library(tidytext)
library(plotly)

beer_awards <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-10-20/beer_awards.csv')

beer_awards1<-beer_awards
theme_set(theme_light())
```

```{r}
state_full<-data.frame(state.abb,state.name)

p<-beer_awards1%>%
  full_join(state_full, by = c("state" = "state.abb"))%>%
  count(state.name, year)%>%
  group_by(state.name)%>%
  mutate(csum = cumsum(n))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  filter(!is.na(year))%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  arrange(year, -csum)%>%
  mutate(rank = 1:n())%>%
  filter(rank<=10)%>%
  mutate(csum = as.integer(csum))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = csum, fill = state.name))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = csum),  hjust=-0.1, family = "Times")+
  geom_text(x = -9, y = 800, aes(label = as.factor(year)), 
            size = 16,
            color = "grey18", family = "Times")+
  geom_text(aes(label = state.name),   y =0, hjust = 1.25, family = "Times")+
  coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = TRUE) +
  scale_x_reverse()+
  ylim(-100,1200)+
  labs(title = "How you brewing?",
       subtitle = "This is a racing bar plot illustrating how the total number of awards received by each state chagnes\n from 1987 to 2020. In particular, California has been taking the first place for almost 20 years.")+ 
  theme_ipsum()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", family = "Times"),
        plot.subtitle =  element_text(size = 12, family = "Times"))+
  transition_states(as.factor(year),transition_length = 4, state_length = 2)+
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade() + 
  ease_aes('quadratic-in-out') 

animate(p, width = 550, height = 500, fps = 25, duration = 15, rewind = FALSE)

```



## 2.2 Animated Map of the US

To show how the total number of awards changes national-wide, we create the following animated map. In this way, instead of focusing on the top states, we can also know how other states performs in each year.  

```{r}

beer_awards2<-beer_awards

state_full<-data.frame(state.abb,state.name)


beer_awards2<-beer_awards2%>%
  full_join(state_full, by = c("state" = "state.abb"))%>%
  count(state.name, year)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)%>%
  select(-"NA")%>%
  pivot_longer(2:35,names_to = "year",values_to = "n")%>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         state.name = tolower(state.name))%>%
  group_by(state.name)%>%
  arrange(year)%>%
  group_by(state.name)%>%
  mutate(csum = cumsum(n))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  filter(!is.na(year))

names(beer_awards2)[1]<-"region"


state<-map_data("state")


p3<-beer_awards2%>%left_join(state)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = csum))+
  geom_polygon()+
  transition_manual(year) +
  ggtitle("The total number of awards received by each state in: {current_frame}")+
  scale_fill_viridis()+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold", family = "Times"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank()
  )


animate(p3,fps=3)


```


## 2.3 Geofacet graph

From the first and second graph, we only get to know the how total number of awards changes over time. As a result, to make the graph more informative, we use the geofacet graph so that we can show the total number of golden, silver, and bronze medals received by each state.

```{r}

beer_awards3<-beer_awards
```


```{}
state_full<-data.frame(state.abb,state.name)


beer_awards3<-beer_awards3%>%
  full_join(state_full, by = c("state" = "state.abb"))%>%
  count(state.name,medal)%>%
  mutate(medal = factor(medal, levels = c("Bronze","Silver","Gold")))

beer_awards3[142:144,1]<-"District of Columbia"

beer_awards3[135,2]<-"Gold"

beer_awards3%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = medal, fill = medal))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#cd7f32","azure3", "gold"))+
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1)+
  facet_geo(~state.name, grid = "us_state_grid2",scales = "free_x")+
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "The total number of awards received by each state for their beer production",
       subtitle = "This graph summarises how many golden, silver, and bronze medals each state in USA has received from 1987 to 2020 for their beer production.\n The top 4 states with most number of total awards are California, Colorado, Oregon, and Texas.Based on this ranking,\n we may infer that the west  part of United States may gain certain geological advantages in beer production.",
       caption = "Produced by Xuxin Zhang(@xux1an)")+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(family = "Times", size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Times", size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    strip.text = element_text(color = "black",family = "Times",face ="bold", size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
  )
```
